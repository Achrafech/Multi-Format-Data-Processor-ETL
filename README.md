# Multi-Format Data Processor ETL

## Description
This Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool is designed to handle and process data from multiple formats, including CSV, JSON, and XML. It efficiently extracts data from these sources, applies necessary transformations, and outputs the results into a CSV file, facilitating the management and analysis of diverse datasets.

## Features
- **Data Extraction:** Compatible with CSV, JSON, and XML formats.
- **Data Transformation:** Configurable transformation rules to meet specific data processing requirements.
- **Data Loading:** Generates a consolidated CSV file from various input data sources.
- **Logging:** Records all processing steps, errors, and important events to a log file, aiding in troubleshooting and ensuring traceability of data handling.

## Usage
1. **Setup:** Ensure Python 3.x and necessary libraries are installed.
2. **Configuration:** Adjust the script to point to your input files, specify transformation rules, and set up logging preferences.
3. **Execution:** Run the script with Python to execute the ETL process. Review the log file for details on the execution flow and any issues encountered.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Libraries for handling XML and JSON files, such as `xml.etree.ElementTree` and others as needed.
